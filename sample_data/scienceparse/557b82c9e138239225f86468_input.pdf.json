    "abstractText" : "In an analysis of seismic-energy release during 11 sequences of earthquakes that in retrospect can be classed as foreshocks, the accelerating rate of energy release follows, at least in part, a simple equation. This equation (1) is d(Z/E)/dt=C/(t -t)-, where Z/E is the cumulative sum until time, t_, of the square roots of individual foreshock energies computed from reported magnitudes; C_ and ri are constants; and t is a limiting time at which the rate of energy release becomes infinite. The possible time of a major foreshock or main shock, t , is found by the best fit of equation (1), or its integral, to step-like plots of Z/E versus time using successive estimates of t f in linearized regressions until the maximum coefficient of ? determination, r., is obtained. Analyzed examples include sequences preceding earthquakes at Cremasta, Greece, 2/5/66; Haicheng, China, 2/M/75; Oaxaca, Mexico, 11/29/78; Petatlan, Mexico, 3/1^/79; and Central Chile, 3/3/85. In 31 estimates of main-shock time, made as the sequences developed, the errors in 24 were less than one-half and in 10 less than one tenth the time remaining between the time of the last data used and the main shock. Some precursory sequences, or parts of them, yield no solution. Two sequences appear to include in their first parts the aftershocks of a previous event; plots using the integral of equation (1) show the sequences are easily separable into aftershock and foreshock segments. If synthetic seismic sequences of shocks at equal time intervals are constrained to follow equation (1) for various values of ri, the resulting distributions of magnitudes closely follow the linear Gutenberg-Richter relation log N=a_-bM, and n. times b_ is a constant. Rate-process theory and continuum damage mechanics appear to offer leads toward understanding the physical bases for equation (1). In various forms and for decades, equation (1) has been used successfully to predict failure times of stressed metals and ceramics, landslides in soil and rock slopes, and volcanic eruptions.",
